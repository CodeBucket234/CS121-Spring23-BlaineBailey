Activity 5 uses the .equals() method with conditionals to test Strings. Activity 5 features 1 class.

RestaurantSelector.java uses a Scanner object to get user input on whether any member of their party was vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian. The strings the user inputted would have .toLowerCase() applied to them so that the program would be case-insensitive. Then based on the responses the user typed in, the program would use conditionals utilizing .equals() to select restaurants catering to the need of all members.

The hardest part of this activity was creating the conditionals because there is three criteria used in this program to describe the needs of the members. I was originally setting up the conditionals to be more specific and testing all cases together, which caused a mess and I would kose track of the restaurants that would cater to which needs. I then realized that the assignment made the conditionals easier, because being vegan was the most restrictive, then gluten-free, with vegetarian being the least restrictive. All gluten-free restaurants were also vegan. Thus, the conditionals were simplified.
