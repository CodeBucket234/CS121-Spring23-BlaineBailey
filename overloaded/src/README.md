Activity 14 utilizes overloaded constructors to allow for objects to be created in different ways. Activity 14 has two classes.

Pokemon.java has one public string: name, and 3 private integers: health, level, and defense. This class features an overloaded constructor that has three variations: a default constructor that creates a "MissingNo" pokemon, a constructor that creates a base pokemon with a name passed through the parameter, and a constructor that creates a pokemon with a custom name and custom stats. Getters and setters are used to access the instance variables and change them. An overloaded method is also present in this class. LevelUp() adds an additional level to the pokemon, adds 5 hp, and adds 2 defense. LevelUp(int newLevels) adds the specified amount of levels, adds 5 hp per level, and 2 defense per level.

Main.java creates three instances of the Pokemon class, each using different variations of the overloaded constructor. The second pokemon is chosen, and getters are used to display the current state of the pokemon. Then LevelUp() is used, and the current state of the second pokemon is displayed again using getters. Then LevelUp(4) is used to level up the second pokemon 4 more times, and the pokemon's stats is displayed again using getters.
