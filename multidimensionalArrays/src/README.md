Activity 16 creates and prints the contents of multidimensional arrays. Activity 16 has 3 classes.

ArrayDemo1.java creates a 3x3x3x3 integer multidimensional array containing all the numbers between 1 through 81. Then a traditional for loop is used to display the contents of the 4D array.

ArrayDemo2.java creates a 3x3x3x3 integer multidimensional array containing all the numbers between 82 through 162. Then a for each loop is used to display the contents of the 4D array.

ArrayDemo3.java creates a 3x3x3 String array of products, and a traditional for each loop is used to display a product and its location.

The hardest part of Activity 16 was using a for each loop to print out the contents of a 4D loop because I was having trouble with what I was supposed to use the for each statement with the multidimensional arrays. I had to rely on the teacher for help.
