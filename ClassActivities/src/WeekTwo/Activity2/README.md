Activity 2 has two classes: BookClubPoints and TestScores.

BookClubPoints uses JOptionPane dialog boxes in order to gather user input on the number of books the user has purchased. Conditional if-else statements are used to assign points to the user based on how many books are purchased.

TestScores uses a Scanner object to gather three test scores from the user. The average is then calculated, and if-else statements are used to assign a grade to the user based on the average test score.
