Activity 1 has two classes: UserName and UserNumbers.

The UserName class uses the Scanner class for getting the user to enter their first and last name. Then the class will print put the fill name. The class will also print out the lowercase, uppercase, and reverse version of the name.

The UserNumbers uses dialog boxes from JOptionPane to get two numbers from the user. The class then performs various options using the two numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square rooting both numbers, the first number to the power of the second number, and logarithm of both numbers. The results of each operation is displayed.
