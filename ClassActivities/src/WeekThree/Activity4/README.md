Activity 4 utilizes switch statements to test for conditions. Activity 4 only has one class.

SwitchActivity.java utilizes a scanner object for users to input a planet from the solar system. The program uses .toLowerCase() on the planet String to ensure that the program is case-insensitive. The program will then run through the test cases and display information for different planets based on the planet the user chose. If the user does not enter in a planet from the solar system, a statement is printed to the console letting the user know.
