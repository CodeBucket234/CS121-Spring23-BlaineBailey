Activity 3 focuses on conditionals and logical operators. Activity 3 has 3 classes.

EvenOrOdd.java is a class that tests if the number the user inputs through a Scanner object is even or odd using a conditional statement with a modulus logical operator.

Login.java is a class that uses JOptionPane to gather the username and password from the user. Then conditionals using the .equals() method is used to compare whether the username and password match, or whether one or both are incorrect.

Triangles.java is a class that uses a Scanner object to get three sides of a triangle from the user, and then the sides are compared to determine whether the triangle is equilateral, scalene, isosceles, or not a triangle.

The hardest part of the assignment was figuring out the appropriate conditionals to use for comparing the sides of the triangle in Triangles.java because I accidentally made an error where one could make side 1 and side 3 equal and not side 2 and the program would report the triangle as being scalene. I had made an error with one of my conditionals and made an adjustment to fix the error.
