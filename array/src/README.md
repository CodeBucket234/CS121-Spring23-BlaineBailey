Activity 15 uses arrays to store data. Activity 15 has one class.

ArrayFromInput.java uses a Scanner object for user input. Two string arrays: names and types, and one integer array: health, is created, all with a length of 4, to store data for different pokemon. A for loop is used to fill in each array by having the user enter in all the stats for each pokemon. The contents of all the arrays are then displayed in a table format.

The hardest part of this activity was displaying the content of the arrays in a table format because I did not know how to create a table. I had to get help from the teacher for that.
