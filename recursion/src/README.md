Activity 23 creates a palindrome detector. Activity 23 has two classes.

PalindromeDetector.java detects a palindrome by creating a backwards version of the string, which consist of using a for loop to reverse the string. If the lowercase string matches the lowercase reverse string, then the string is a palindrome, and true is returned. Otherwise, false is returned.

TestClass.java creates an instance of the PalindromeDetector class. The PalindromeDetector object is then used to test whether "Tacocat" and "Hello Stacy" are palindromes or not. The program will say that Tacocat is a palindrome, while Hello Stacy is not.

The hardest part of Activity 23 apparently is making the isPalindrome method recursive because the method is not actually recursive like it is supposed to be.
