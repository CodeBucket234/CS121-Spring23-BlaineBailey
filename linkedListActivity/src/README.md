Activity 31 uses linked lists to store course information for students. Activity 31 has two classes.

Student.java has 5 private strings: first name, last name, ID, major, and class standing, and one private double variable: gpa. A private linked list, courseList, is also created. The constructor creates a student with a custom first name, last name, ID, major, class standing, and gpa. The addClass method adds a class, while removeCourse removes a course. The getStudentInfo method returns a formatted string with all the student's information. The displayStudentCourses method prints out all the courses on the course list.

Main.java creates two instances of the Student class, and adds 4 courses for each, displays their student information, removes one course, and displays their remaining course list.
