In this project, the user enters how many rounds that the user would like to play. Each round, player 1 and player 2 will then enter 5 stats for their pokemon: the name of the pokemon, the health of the pokemon, the name of the move, the move speed, and the move power. Once all the rounds are over, the player that wins the most rounds wins. This project uses 1 class, and utilizes conditionals and loops.
