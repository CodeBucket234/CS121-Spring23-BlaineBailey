Activity 24 is about creating methods running in different time complexities. Activity 24 has two classes.

BigO.java has 3 methods running in different time complexities. The printOnce method prints the number passed through one time, and runs in constant time, or O(1). The printNTimes method prints a phrase the number of times passed through, and runs in linear time, or O(n). The printNSquaredTimes method prints a statement out the number of times passed through squared, and runs in quadratic time, or O(nÂ²).

Test.java creates an instance of the BigO class, and uses this object to call all three methods.
