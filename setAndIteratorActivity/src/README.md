Activity 28 uses sets and iterators. Activity 28 has two classes.

StudentSet.java has a private hashset students, which stores students in a set. A scanner object is used for input. The addStudents method uses a while loop to allow the user to keep adding students to the set until the user types "q", in which case the break statement breaks out of the while loop. The displayStudents method uses an iterator object to display all the students in the hashset.

Main.java creates an instance of the StudentSet class and calls the addStudents method. Then, the displayStudents method is called to display all the students added in by the user.
