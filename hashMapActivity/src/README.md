Activity 30 uses hashmaps and the different methods associated with hashmaps. Activity 30 has two classes.

HashMapActivity.java has a private hashmap. The class also has the methods addPair to add a key value pair, removePair to remove a key value pair based on the key, getValue to get a value based on its key, and display to display the key value pair based on the key.

Main.java creates an instance of the HashMapActivity class, and uses the addPair method to add 3 key value pairs. Each of these key value pairs is displayed based on the key. Then one of the key value pairs is removes based on the key, and the remaining key value pairs are displayed.
