ESPGame.java creates a Scanner object for input and a Random object for random number generation. A random number 0 through 4 is generated, which determines the color selected. Then the user enters in the color the user thinks was chosen, and .toLowerCase() is applied for case-insensitivity. The computer tells the user what color it chose and if the user was right, the correct guess is tracked. This process is cycles through 100 times with a for loop. The number of coorect guesses at the end is displayed.
