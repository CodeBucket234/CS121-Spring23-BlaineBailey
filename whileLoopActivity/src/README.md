Activity 7 utilizes while loops and random numbers for a guessing game. Activity 7 uses one class.

GuessingGame.java starts off by generating a random number between 1 and 100. Then the program uses a while loop to allow the user to make as many guesses as needed before getting the correct number. The program uses a Scanner object to allow the user to input their guess. The program also keeps track of the number of guesses the user takes to get the correct number. If the guess is too low, then the user is informed that the correct number is higher. If the guess is too high, the user is informed the number is lower. If the user types in "q", then the program quits and tells the user the number. If the user gets the correct number, they are told that the guess is correct, and the number of guesses made is displayed.
