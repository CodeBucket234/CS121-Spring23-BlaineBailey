Activity 33 uses queues to store data. Activity 33 has two classes.

LinkedListDemo.java is a class that has all the methods necessary to create a queue. A private node class contains data and a pointer that references the next data. The enqueue method adds daa to a queue, while unenqueue removes data that was first added to the queue. Peek returns the element that was added first. The isEmpty method returns true if the queue is empty, and false otherwise. The size method returns the size of the queue. The displayQueue method displays all the elements in a queue.

LinkedListQueueTester.java creates an instance of the LinkedListDemo class. The LinkedListDemo objects is used to call all the methods to add elements to the queue, return and display whether the queue is empty and the size of the queue, return the first element in the queue, and remove elements in the queue. The displayQueue method is used occasionally to display all the names in the queue.
