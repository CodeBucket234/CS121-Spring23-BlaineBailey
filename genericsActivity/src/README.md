Activity 29 uses a generic method to print the contents of array lists no matter the data type. Activity 29 has two methods.

GenericMethods.java has one generic method: printArrayList, which prints the contents of the array list no matter the type of array list that gets passed through.

Main.java creates 4 array lists of different types. Then an instance of the GenericMethods class is created, which is used for passing through all the array lists through the printArrayList method.
