Activity 8 uses nested for loops. Activity 8 has one class.

TestAverage.java uses JOptionPane dialog boxes to get the number of students and the number of tests per student. Then, the program uses nested for loops to get the user to enter scores for each test for each student. After entering all the test scores for an individual student, the test average for the student is calculated and displayed. The user will continue to enter in all tests for all students.
